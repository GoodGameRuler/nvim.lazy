# My Neovim Setup - Lazy Plugin Manager

## Introduction

## Setup
> Unfortunately this setup up does have a few requirements.

- I use nvim nightly. I cannot guarentee this repo works for any other version. If you are on a debian, ubuntu, or fedora variant please ensure your **nvim version is at least 0.9**.
- Requires NodeJS 14+
- Requires Python, Python-Pip, Python-Env, Python3-is-Python packages 
- Requires Lua Rocks
- Requires CMake
- Requires Go (Last I remember)
- For minimal issues and setup `fzf` or `fzy` before you install this config.
